🌿 Herbalogy 

This is my first-year university group project (2024) – a simple Herbalogy Website built with HTML, CSS, and PHP (for database).

The website provides basic herb-related information along with external purchase links, allowing users to learn about herbs and easily redirect to trusted sources for buying them.

Developed together with my teammate Abid, this project was our first step into building real-world projects and applying web development fundamentals.

📖 Project Overview

The website is herb-based 🌱.

Each herb includes:

   🌿 Name & information
  
   🛒 External "Buy" link (redirects to other websites to purchase)

The project is mostly static (basic frontend + database).

No backend logic – only database is used for storing herb info.

Designed as a beginner project for learning web development.
